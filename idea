Pact App - Discussion Summary
Core Concept Evolution
Started As:
A social accountability app where friends put money on the line to build habits together, with options to split winnings or donate to charity.

Evolved Into:
A competitive fitness battle app where friends compete with real money stakes in "last person standing" challenges, featuring savage roasts and public eliminations for entertainment value.

Key Design Decisions
1. Pact Modes
Challenge Mode: Common goal for everyone, last person standing wins entire pot
Accountability Mode: Individual goals, multiple winners split the pot
MVP Focus: Start with Challenge Mode only (simpler, more viral)
2. Goal Types (MVP)
Quantifiable, API-verifiable only (steps, screen time, run distance)
No subjective goals requiring voting
Automatic tracking via Apple Health/fitness APIs
3. Technical Architecture
On-Chain (Minimal):

Binary pass/fail per day (bitmap storage)
Stakes and pot management
Strike count and eliminations
Automated payouts
Off-Chain (Everything Else):

Detailed progress data
API responses and proofs
Roast messages and social features
User profiles and stats
4. Smart Contract Structure
rust

// One Player account per wallet (permanent)
// Participants embedded in Pact account (not separate PDAs)
// Maximum 10-15 participants per pact
// Use bitmaps for daily progress (gas efficient)

5. User Experience
Onboarding: Email/social login → automatic wallet (Privy)
Payment: Apple Pay → USDC conversion (seamless)
Daily: Automatic tracking, no manual logging
Elimination: 2 strikes = eliminated with roast messages
Social: Shareable eliminations, Hall of Shame, badges
6. Business Model
Take 5% of forfeited funds only
No fees if everyone succeeds
App pays all gas fees (invisible to users)
Start with $100 seed funding for gas
The Final Vision
Pact is a Gen Z-focused competitive fitness app where:

Friends battle with the same fitness goal
Miss 2 days = get eliminated and roasted
Last person standing wins everything
Eliminations are entertaining content
Built on Solana with invisible crypto UX
The Vibe: "Survivor meets fitness tracker with your friend group's money on the line"

Next Steps
Rohit: Build minimal smart contracts (create pact, join, daily updates, eliminate, payout)
Ishika: Build React Native app with Privy integration
Week 1 Goal: Working MVP with 3 goal types, basic UI, real money stakes
The app has shifted from "supportive group accountability" to "savage competition that makes losing fun" - which is much more viral and engaging for the target audience.
